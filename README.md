Hi!
As you probably figured out from my username, my name is Joseph.
I have been programming for nearly 1.5 years (as of May 6th 2022 - which is when I am updating this file), and have acquired/strengthened skills such as:
- Problem Solving
- Web Scraping
- Working with APIs and internet client - server coonections
- Working with websockets and HTTP request APIs
- Building and designing applications
- Adapting to different situations

So far, I have most frequently used Python, JavaScript and Java. It can be truthfully said that I understand the basic syntax of multiple other languages, but the mentioned three are my main ones.
In Python, I have used the following libraries multiple times for a fair amount of projects and little scripts:
- `requests`
- `flask`/`flask-socketio`
- `Pillow`
- `websocket-client`/`websockets`
- `re`
- `cv2`
- `discord.py`
- `io`
In JavaScript, I have used the following APIs and libraries:
-  `http` (NodeJS)
-  `https` (NodeJS)
-  `fs` (NodeJS)
-  `express` (NodeJS)
-  `discord.js` (NodeJS)
-  `axios` (NodeJS)
-  `got` (NodeJS)
-  `ws` (NodeJS)
-  `XMlHttpRequest` (Vanilla)
-  `speechSynthesis` (Vanilla)
-  `SpeechRecognition` (Vanilla)
I do not have as much experience in Java as I do in Python and JavaScript, but I am working to diversify my skills in that language. My main Java project is Minecraft modding. I don't have any fully developed mods yet, but once I do, I'll post it.
Some things that I want to learn in Java are:
- Database connectivity
- Working with files and data collection
- Internet - layer things such as webservers, APIs, HTTP requests and websockets
- How to structure libraries using object - oriented design
